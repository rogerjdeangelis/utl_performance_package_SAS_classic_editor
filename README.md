Below are a set of command macros that can greatly increase your programming performance.  I have over 20 of these performance command macros mapped to my logitech G203 5 button mouse  and many more mapped to function keys, and if this in not enough the same command macros can be called with and without arguments from the SAS classic editor command line.  All of SAS, R, Python and Perl can operate directly on the SAS command line or on text the in the SAS classic (1980s) editor. Python functions and code can be also be executed by mouse keys.
